"""Manual integration test cases for inventory CLI commands.

These tests require manual execution with proper AWS credentials
and are documented here as test scenarios rather than automated tests.

To run these manually:
1. Ensure AWS credentials are configured
2. Create a clean test environment (use a test AWS account)
3. Run commands manually and verify output
