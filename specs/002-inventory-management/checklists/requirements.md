# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Account Inventory Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification is ready for planning phase

### Review Notes:

1. **Content Quality**: All sections are focused on WHAT and WHY, not HOW. No programming languages, frameworks, or technical implementations mentioned. Stakeholder-friendly language used throughout.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - All 22 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all design questions were resolved through user discussion
   - Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, performance, accuracy percentages)
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of implementation specifics)

3. **User Scenarios**:
   - 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P4) covering complete feature lifecycle
   - Each story has clear acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
   - Independent test criteria defined for each story
   - 8 edge cases identified covering error conditions and boundary scenarios

4. **Scope and Dependencies**:
   - Clear assumptions documented (9 items)
   - Dependencies on existing systems identified (5 items)
   - Open questions section explicitly states "None" after user clarifications

5. **Success Criteria Validation**:
   - SC-001: "Users can create a new inventory and take a filtered snapshot in under 2 minutes" - Measurable, user-focused
   - SC-002: "System correctly segregates snapshots" - Verifiable through testing
   - SC-003-007: All metrics are technology-agnostic and measurable

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase to generate implementation tasks.

## Notes

- Specification incorporates design clarifications from user conversation
- All functional requirements map to user stories
- Edge cases identified will inform error handling in implementation
- No further clarifications needed before planning phase
