# Tasks: AWS Baseline Snapshot & Delta Tracking

**Feature Branch**: `001-aws-baseline-snapshot`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-aws-baseline-snapshot/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/cli-commands.md

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification - focusing on implementation tasks

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. User stories are organized by priority (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3).

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Create Historical Baseline (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable administrators to create baseline snapshots representing resources as they existed at specific points in time, filtered by creation date and tags, for retroactive baseline establishment

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Can proceed in parallel if multiple developers available
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1 (P1) ‚Üí US5 (P2) ‚Üí US2 (P2) ‚Üí US3 (P2) ‚Üí US4 (P3) ‚Üí US6 (P3)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 - Capture Baseline Snapshot (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories - can start immediately after Foundational
- **US2 - View Resource Delta (P2)**: Depends on US1 (needs snapshot functionality) but independently testable
- **US3 - Analyze Cost Delta (P2)**: Depends on US1 (needs snapshot functionality) but independently testable
- **US4 - Restore to Baseline (P3)**: Depends on US1 and US2 (needs snapshot and delta) but independently testable
- **US5 - Create Historical Baseline (P2)**: Enhances US1 (adds filtering to snapshot create) - minimal dependencies
- **US6 - Manage Multiple Snapshots (P3)**: Enhances US1 (adds snapshot management commands) - minimal dependencies

### Within Each User Story

- Models/collectors can run in parallel (marked [P])
- Core implementation before integration
- CLI commands after core functionality is complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: T006-T010 (models), T012-T013 (AWS utils), T016-T019 (utilities) can all run in parallel
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: T023-T031 (all resource collectors) can run in parallel
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T040 and T043 can run in parallel
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: T050, T057 can run in parallel
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: T064, T067, T071 can run in parallel
- **Phase 7 (US5)**: T078 and T082 can start in parallel
- **Phase 8 (US6)**: T091-T094 (CLI commands) can run in parallel
- **Phase 9**: Most tasks can run in parallel (T097-T108, T112-T113)

**Once Foundational (Phase 2) completes**: US1, US5, US6 can start in parallel (different files). Then US2, US3 can start. Finally US4.

4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test snapshot create command on test AWS account
5. Verify all resources captured with correct metadata
6. Deploy/demo MVP

**MVP Delivers**: Ability to capture complete baseline snapshots - the foundation for all other features

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. **Iteration 1**: Setup + Foundational + US1 (Capture Baseline) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
   - Users can start creating baseline snapshots
2. **Iteration 2**: + US5 (Historical Baseline) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
   - Users can create date/tag-filtered baselines
3. **Iteration 3**: + US2 (View Delta) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
   - Users can track resource changes
4. **Iteration 4**: + US3 (Cost Analysis) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy

5. **Iteration 5**: + US6 (Snapshot Management) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
   - Users can manage multiple snapshots
6. **Iteration 6**: + US4 (Restore) + Polish ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
   - Full feature set complete

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Together**: Complete Phase 1 (Setup) and Phase 2 (Foundational)
2. **After Foundational complete**:
   - Developer A: US1 (Snapshot Capture - P1) - highest priority
   - Developer B: US5 (Historical Baseline - P2) - enhances US1
   - Developer C: US6 (Snapshot Management - P3) - enhances US1
3. **After US1 complete**:
   - Developer D: US2 (Delta - P2) - depends on US1
   - Developer E: US3 (Cost - P2) - depends on US1
4. **After US1, US2 complete**:
   - Developer F: US4 (Restore - P3) - depends on US1, US2
5. **All**: Phase 9 (Polish) together

---

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 114
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 5 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 16 tasks (BLOCKING)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Capture Baseline)**: 18 tasks
- **Phase 4 (US2 - View Delta)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Cost Analysis)**: 14 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Restore)**: 14 tasks
- **Phase 7 (US5 - Historical Baseline)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 8 (US6 - Snapshot Management)**: 9 tasks
- **Phase 9 (Polish)**: 18 tasks

**Parallelizable Tasks**: 55 tasks marked with [P] (48%)

**Estimated MVP Effort** (Phase 1 + 2 + 3): 39 tasks for basic snapshot capture functionality

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks can run in parallel (different files, no inter-task dependencies)
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently testable
- Commit frequently (after each task or logical group)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Foundational phase (Phase 2) must be 100% complete before starting any user story
- User stories can be implemented in priority order or in parallel (if team capacity allows)
