# Specification Quality Checklist: AWS Baseline Snapshot & Delta Tracking

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

**Content Quality**: PASSED
- Spec focuses on what users need (snapshot, delta, cost tracking, restore) without mentioning Python, boto3, or specific implementation approaches
- All content describes user value: cost allocation, drift tracking, cleanup automation
- Written in business language that finance, operations, and cloud administrators can understand
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete with detailed content

**Requirement Completeness**: PASSED
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are fully specified
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001 can be verified by checking if snapshot includes all listed resource types)
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time: "under 5 minutes", accuracy: "less than 1% error", success rate: "95% of resources")
- Success criteria avoid implementation (e.g., SC-001 measures user outcome "capture snapshot in under 5 minutes" not system details like "API calls complete")
- 5 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format
- 10 edge cases identified covering error scenarios, multi-region, data gaps, etc.
- Scope clearly defined in "Out of Scope" section (15 items explicitly excluded)
- Dependencies section lists 8 external dependencies, Assumptions section lists 10 assumptions

**Feature Readiness**: PASSED
- Each of 20 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios cover complete workflow: create baseline (P1) → view delta (P2) → analyze costs (P2) → restore (P3) → manage snapshots (P3)
- 10 success criteria align with measurable outcomes from user stories
- Spec maintains technology-agnostic stance throughout - Dependencies section mentions boto3 but spec body does not

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. No clarifications needed - all aspects of the feature are well-defined with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section.

The specification successfully balances detail with technology-agnosticism:
- WHAT: Snapshot AWS resources, track deltas, separate costs, restore to baseline
- WHY: Enable cost allocation, track drift, automate cleanup
- Does NOT specify HOW: No mention of data structures, algorithms, UI frameworks, or implementation patterns

Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (though clarification not needed).
